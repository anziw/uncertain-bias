<h1>Consent Form</h1>

<h2>Overview and Procedure:</h2>
<p>We are interested in the expressions people use to describe images. In this study, you will be presented with images. A fictional person “A”, who cannot see the images, will ask you questions about the images. For each of A’s questions, you will also be presented with three possible responses. Your task is to decide how likely you are to pick each of the three responses to answer the question. After the experiment, you will also be asked to provide some demographic information, including your age, gender, political preference, and language background. We expect this entire process to take approximately 20 minutes.<br>
We might contact you at a later point to offer you an opportunity to participate in a follow-up experiment. You are entirely free to choose whether or not to participate in the follow-up experiment. Your compensation for this experiment is not contingent on your participation in the follow-up.</p>

<h2>Risks and Discomforts:</h2> 
<p>The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in daily life.</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2> 
<p>There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. This study may benefit society if the results lead to a better understanding of what factors may influence how people process language.</p>

<h2>Voluntary Participation and Right to Withdraw:</h2>
<p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary: You choose whether to participate. If you decide not to participate, there are no penalties, and you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled.<br>
If you choose to participate in the study, you can stop your participation at any time, without any penalty or loss of benefits. If you want to withdraw from the study, please just close the window in which you are taking the survey.</p>

<h2>Researchers' Standards of Confidentiality:</h2>
<p>All information obtained over the course of this study will remain confidential and will be used solely for the purposes of the experiment. We will not collect any identifiable information other than your Prolific ID. We will use this Prolific ID to verify your participation. We might also contact you for a follow-up experiment through the Prolific messaging system. Only the researchers in this experiment will be able to link your data to your Prolific ID — before making any of this data publicly available, we will replace your Prolific ID with a random ID. Prolific may process your email address, but this information is not accessible to the researchers of this study, and it will not be stored longer than necessary. Your confidentiality will be protected to the extent allowed by law. This means that if, during the study, a court of law asks for your responses we are legally bound to supply the requested information. </p> 

<h2>Prolific Standards of Confidentiality:</h2>
<p>Prolific uses encrypted HTTPS connections, secured by Transport Layer Security (TLS). Participants are fully anonymized; they are assigned a unique participant ID (24 character alphanumeric). Prolific provides an anonymized internal messaging service, which allows participants to message researchers (and vice versa) with any concerns. Researchers cannot access participants’ identifiable information, and clear guidance is provided on what information researchers cannot request. User data is stored within secure Google Cloud Platform servers located in Belgium. Passwords are hashed using industry approved technologies; they are stored securely and cannot be viewed by Prolific. Prolific does not store any data provided within studies. These are carried out on external survey software/platforms. In accordance with The General Data Protection Regulation requirements, participants are free to amend or remove their personal data at any time, and personal data is deleted within a reason period after account closure as well.</p>

<h2>Compensation:</h2>
<p>You will receive compensation through Prolific upon completion of this experiment.</p>

<h2>If you have questions or concerns:</h2>
<p>You can ask questions about this research study now or at any time during the study, by emailing the researcher Anzi Wang at awang1@colgate.edu, or her faculty advisor Dr. Grusha Prasad at gprasad@colgate.edu.<br>
If you have questions about your rights as a research participant or feel that you have not been treated fairly, please contact the Institutional Review Board Chair at Colgate University at irb_chair@colgate.edu.</p>
